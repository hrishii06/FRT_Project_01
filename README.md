## (1) Azure App Services


Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that allows you to build and host web applications, REST APIs, and 
mobile back ends in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. 

It offers auto-scaling, high availability, security, and DevOps capabilities. You can run your apps on Windows or Linux, or use containers and Kubernetes. 

You can also connect to various SaaS platforms and on-premises data sources, and use Azure AI services to enhance your applications.
